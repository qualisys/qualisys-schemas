# Qualisys JSON / YAML schemas

This repository contains JSON Schemas used to validate and give hints on writing YAML and JSON files for Qualisys products and services.

## paf-module.schema.json
This schema is used for Settings.paf files for Qualisys PAF Modules. It is registered on the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) so as long as you have configured your editor to treat `.paf` files as YAML files, it should automatically be used.
